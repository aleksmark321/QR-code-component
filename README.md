#### My comment to the challenge.
This is my first mini project from the challenges prepared by Frontend Mentor. It is a simple window containing a QR code. In this project, I used the Sass preprocessor for the first time. According to the challenge documentation, media queries weren't used in the project. However, I believe that despite this, the project looks good on any screen size.
